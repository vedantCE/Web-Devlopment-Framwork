Notes:
------------

What is classList?

->classList is a JavaScript property of an HTML element.
->It gives you a special object to work with the element’s CSS classes easily.
->Instead of dealing with the whole string of classes manually (like in element.className), classList provides handy methods to add, remove, toggle, or check for classes.

Common methods of classList:

->element.classList.add('class-name') — Adds a CSS class to the element.
->element.classList.remove('class-name') — Removes a CSS class from the element.
->element.classList.toggle('class-name') — Adds the class if it's not there; removes it if it is.
->element.classList.contains('class-name') — Returns true if the element has the class, false otherwise.
